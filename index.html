<div class="text">

<p>
    Throughout Fall 2023, I interned with Google's <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub41761/">Unified Traffic Engineering (UTE)</a> team and assisted in optimizing their B4 intra-datacenter algorithm. 
</p>

<p>
    I joined the <a href="https://seth.engr.tamu.edu/research-2">Texas A&M SETH Lab</a> in February 2023. 
    The lab primarily focuses on hardware fuzzing, AI in hardware security, and hardware reverse engineering attacks. 
    My work is funded by Sandia National Labs, and I utilize hardware fuzzing to detect bugs in their processors. Throughout my time working, 
    I have reviewed extensive code and regularly utilize Python, Verilog, Assembly, and metaprogramming tools, such as Chipyard (CPU emulator), 
    Synopsis VCS, and FPGA emulation. Initially, I contributed to the fuzzing of the Ibex core through simulation. Afterward, I spearheaded the effort in 
    emulating a RISC-V core on an FPGA board, requiring expertise in code instrumentation and FPGA configuration.</p>
  
<p>
    From May 2022 to July 2022, I worked at Herbert-ABS Software Solutions LLC.  Herbert-ABS is a software company concerned with developing analysis and design tools 
    that aid in Maritime tasks.  I first conducted research on a genetic algorithm library that 
    would be compatible with the code base.  There are thousands of Python ML libraries that support different operations.  Mine had to be compatible with
    basic functions, such as crossover and gene mutation.  The ultimate conclusion was that
    no libraries were suitable given our constraints, so we made our own NGSA-II algorithm library. After researching, I ported their old Visual Basic 6 code from a previous release
    to Python 2.7.  The deceivingly challenging task led me to learn about the code base extensively.
    During my final few weeks, I coded in C# on the main HECSTAB software.  Having already familiarized
    myself with the code base, I was able to develop the power optimization and power graph features with ease.
</p>

<p>
    From September 2021 to May 2022 I worked at Texas A&M Research Security Office.  In a broad sense, the Texas A&M RSO investigates potential violations of federal law by academics.  
    A common example of this would be a professor not disclosing they were part of the Chinese Communist Party, nonetheless conducting research funded by the Department of Defense.
    My role at the RSO was to create web tools to aid investigators in clearing people as well as collecting data via open-source data mining.  The web tools are housed internally.
</p>

<p>
    From March 2021 to August 2021 I camped out at Micro Center Dallas buying GPUs and adding to my mining rig.
</p>

<p>
    For the next two summers, I worked as a Lifeguard for the City of Farmers Branch.
</p>

<p>
    I started working when I was 15, assisting tennis lessons for the City of Frederick Parks & Recreation.  There was no initial intention
of getting paid, I simply showed up and helped the employees because I wanted to rally with adults.  After helping pick up balls 
and partially coaching people, they decided to give pay me about $300 at the end of the summer.

<!-- <div class="box">Perspective</div>

<div class="text"> -->


<!-- 
    Goal:
    Discuss where I want to be, what I want to do, why I want to do

    First issue is software fragmentation
    Second issue is not enough talent
    Third issue is rising tensions
-->

<!-- <p>
    The post-Moore's Law era of hardware is here, and there are many problems we need to combat to move
    forward.  The first implication of the end of Moore's Law is a shift from generalized processing units to domain-specific
    accelerators. Given this, industry needs to collaborate to maintain progression at a fast rate.
    More specific hardare means that software needs to be more accomodating, and fragmentation needs to stop.
    Companies such as AMD and NVIDIA make two different hardware acceleration interfaces that perform
    the same function.  This is one of many problems that can be solved by standardization.
    <br><br>
    There are many small problems like this that I need to fix.  In general, I aim to fix many of these problems and push humanity forward.
