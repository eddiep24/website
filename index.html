<div class="text">

<p>
    From May 2022 to July 2022, I worked at Herbert-ABS Software Solutions LLC.  Herbert-ABS is a software company concerned with developing analysis and design tools 
    that aid in Maritime tasks.  The initial task I was given was to do research for a genetic algorithm library that 
    would be compatible with the code base.  The genetic algorithm had to be compatible with
    basic operations, such as crossover and gene mutation.  The ultimate conclusion was that
    no libraries were suitable so we had to make our own NGSA-II library. At Herbert-ABS, my first task was to port Visual Basic 6 code from a previous release
    to Python 2.7.  The decievingly hard task led me to learn about the code base extensively.
    I could not port the code without learning about the backend pipeline of the software.  For my second task, I coded in C# on the main HECSTAB code base.  Having already familiarized
    myself with the code base, I was able to develop the power optimization and power graph features with ease.
</p>

<p>
    From September 2021 to May 2022 I worked at Texas A&M Research Security Office.  I programmed a web tool that
    parses documents and flags words that indicate whether a person might be CCP.
</p>

<p>
    From March 2021 to August 2021 I camped out at Micro Center Dallas buying GPUs for my mining rig. 
</p>

<p>
    For the next two summers I worked as a Lifeguard for the City of Farmers Branch.
</p>

<p>During the Summer of 2018 I got my first job working as a Tennis Assistant for the City of Frederick Parks & Recreation.  There was no initial intention
on getting paid, I simply showed up and helped the employees because I wanted to play with adults.  After helping pick up balls 
and partially coaching people, they decided to give pay me about $300 at the end of the summer.

<div class="text">

<p>
    After having such a large mining rig, I accumulated a new perspective on wealth.  All I could have dreamed
    of as a child was to have a 1080Ti with a Ryzen 9, but now I have over 50 GPUs and over 10 CPUs mining.
    From what I have seen, I believe that the popular thing to do would be to ask for more.  More money. More houses. More cars. More Money.
    In popular culture, frugality is underrated.  All I want in life is enough money to live without a job for a year.
