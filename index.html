<div class="text">

<p>
    From May 2022 to July 2022, I worked at Herbert-ABS Software Solutions LLC.  Herbert-ABS is a software company concerned with developing analysis and design tools 
    that aid in Maritime tasks.  I first conducted research over a genetic algorithm library that 
    would be compatible with the code base.  There are thousands of Python ML libraries that support different operations.  Mine had to be compatible with
    basic operations, such as crossover and gene mutation.  The ultimate conclusion was that
    no libraries were suitable given our constraints, so we made our own NGSA-II algorithm library. After doing research, I ported old Visual Basic 6 code from a previous release
    to Python 2.7.  The decievingly hard task led me to learn about the code base extensively.
    During my final few weeks, I coded in C# on the main HECSTAB code base.  Having already familiarized
    myself with the code base, I was able to develop the power optimization and power graph features with ease.
</p>

<p>
    From September 2021 to May 2022 I worked at Texas A&M Research Security Office.  In a broad sense, the Texas A&M RSO investigates investigates potential violations of federal law by academics.  
    A common example of this would be a professor not disclosing they were part of the Chinese Communist Party, nonetheless conducting research funded by the Department of Defense.
    My role at the RSO was to create web tools to aid investigators in clearing people as well as collecting data via open-source data mining.  The web tools are housed internally.
</p>

<p>
    From March 2021 to August 2021 I camped out at Micro Center Dallas buying GPUs and adding to my mining rig.
</p>

<p>
    For the next two summers I worked as a Lifeguard for the City of Farmers Branch.
</p>

<p>During the Summer of 2018 I got my first job working as a Tennis Assistant for the City of Frederick Parks & Recreation.  There was no initial intention
on getting paid, I simply showed up and helped the employees because I wanted to play with adults.  After helping pick up balls 
and partially coaching people, they decided to give pay me about $300 at the end of the summer.

<div class="box">Philosophy</div>

<div class="text">

<p>
    After having such a large mining rig, I accumulated a new perspective on wealth.  All I could have dreamed
    of as a child was to have a 1080Ti with a Ryzen 9, but now I have over 50 GPUs and over 10 CPUs mining.
    From what I have seen, I believe that the popular thing to do would be to ask for more.  More money. More houses. More cars.
    Yet I believe that frugality is underrated in popular culture.  Living in excess is not sustainable, nor is it healthy.
    Given this, I hope that I can work somewhere that makes a positive influence on the world.
