  As a child, my family in Taiwan always enstilled in me the principle of not wasting anything.
  Naturally, as I have gone back and forth between Taiwan and the US, it's apparent that the American
  way of life is extremely wasteful and excessive.  Every fall, people buy pumpkins simply to 
  decorate their house and then throw them away.  Depending on who (or what) you are, a pumpkin is either food, a decoration, or both.
  For my cows, pumpkins are food that people misuse.

  <br>
  So for four years (and counting), I organize the collection of pumpkins
  from the affluent Highland Park neighborhood to our Ranch in Ivanhoe, Texas.
